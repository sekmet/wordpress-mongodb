wordpress-mongodb
=================

My attempt to port WordPress to use MongoDB. Please refer to the Wiki for more information.

There's already a complete port-over of WordPress for MongoDB here: http://www.mongopress.org/
However, I'm approaching this at a slightly different angle, trying my best not to rewrite the codes but just extend the libraries (if possible) where I can. I hope to make this work as easily as as one would installing a WordPress plugin.
